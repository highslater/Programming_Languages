(* 

6. Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int n and returns the n th element of the
list where the head of the list is 1 st . Do not worry about the case where the list has too few elements:
your function may apply hd or tl to the empty list in this case, which is okay.

val get_nth = fn : string list * int -> string

*)

fun get_nth () =
  true
